## How?
All you have to do is place the Key of Night inside a chest while in the evil biome you want the mimic to be.
So to spawn a crimson mimic in a corrupt world, you need to create an artificial crimson biome and place the Key of Night inside a chest while in the artificial crimson biome.

## How do I create an artificial counterpart evil biome?
By buying the seeds of the biome with the Dryad while in a Graveyard.
