This mod allow you to spawn the evil biome mimic counterpart using the Key of Night.
Example: crimson mimic in a corrupt world. Or the opposite: Corrupt mimic in a crimson world.

All you have to do is place the Key of Night inside a chest while in the evil biome you want the mimic to be.
So to spawn a crimson mimic in a corrupt world, you need to create an artificial crimson biome and place the Key of Night inside a chest while in the artificial crimson biome.

You can create an artificial counterpart evil biome by buying the seeds of the biome with the Dryad while in a Graveyard.
